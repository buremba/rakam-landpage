> Google allows you to export all of the Google searches that you’ve done since you created your Google account. Despite this ability, to date there wasn’t a dashboard for analyzing this historical data. Because of this I figured it would be interesting if I could download my search history from Google and analyze the data and create a dashboard in Rakam.

This February we published an [article](https://blog.rakam.io/analyzing-your-google-search-history-with-rakam-cee5acf80be9) on analysing your Google search history. We’ve got great feedback and attention around our blog post (*10K viewers | 7.2K readers (%72 read ratio*)) and after a while we decided that we can create a side project in [Rakam](http://app.rakam.io/static/utils/google-takeout.html) which gives you to the ability to analyze and also understand your Google Search & Location History with in **one click**. (No sweat needed, seriously! :))

We’re really interesting guys and love to learn interesting things about our own lives. Hope you do! :)

## Let’s get started… → [Click here](http://app.rakam.io/static/utils/google-takeout.html) and open the project.

**#Step1:** It’s pretty easy to export the data from,** use this link: [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?pli=1).**

**#Step 3:** Upload your folder to rakam and define your project name like: “nurk_search17”

Up to 25-30 seconds magic will be happen. You can say hi to your Google History and understand actually what you’ve done so far. :)
