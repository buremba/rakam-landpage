  desc: "You basically connect to your Redshift cluster, map your event data and build interactive reporting user interfaces."
content: "It's often not efficient to use generic BI tools for the customer event data because event data has different semantics. You usually want to run ad-hoc funnel, retention and segmentation queries, label your event types and share them internally which is not convenient in generic BI tools. That's why we created Rakam for just the product event data. Rakam answers these questions in a seamless way and lets you drill-down these metrics so that you can understand how your users are behaving."
