  headline: The UI of your Segment Warehouse
  image: images/integration/segment.svg
  desc: We already know the data layout of Segment warehouse, you can connect to your
    Segment Warehouse and analyze your customer event data without hassle.
content: It's often not efficient to use generic BI tools for the Segment data because
  event data has different semantics. You usually want to run ad-hoc funnel, retention
  and segmentation queries, label your event types and share them internally which
  is not convenient in generic BI tools. That's why we created Rakam for just the
  product event data. Rakam answers these questions in a seamless way and lets you
  drill-down these metrics so that you can understand how your users are behaving.
