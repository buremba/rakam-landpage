                NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR
                OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE

                <br>
                UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF RAKAM ARISING OUT OF
                OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES AND SERVICE CONTENT (INCLUDING

                OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE AMOUNTS, IF ANY, THAT YOU HAVE PAID TO US FOR
                YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES AND SERVICE CONTENT IN THE TWELVE MONTH PERIOD
                IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM OR ACTION. IN
                ADDITION, IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL
                CODE §1542, WHICH SAYS: A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS
                WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT
                THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE
                MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR. BECAUSE SOME STATES
                DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL
                OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
                INDEMNITY<br>
                You will indemnify and hold us, our agents, employees, directors,
                suppliers and licensors, and our respective subsidiaries, affiliates,
                officers, agents, employees, representatives, and assigns harmless from
                any costs, damages, expenses, and liability caused by your use of the
                Services and Service Content (including your use of Customer Data with
                the Services), your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any
                rights of a third party through use of the Services or Service Content.<br>
                <br>
                LEGAL NOTICES<br>
                The Services are controlled and operated from Rakam's office in the
                United States. Rakam makes no representations that the Services are
                appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access
                or use the Services from other jurisdictions do so at their own
                volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all
                applicable United States laws, state and local laws and regulations,
                including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not
                use the Services if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the
                United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by
                the United State government.<br>
                <br>
                Enforcement of these Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of
                California, excluding its conflict and choice of law principles. The
                exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims arising out of or
                related to these Terms or your use of the Services or Service Content
                will lie in the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County,
                within the State of California, and you irrevocably agree to submit to
                the jurisdiction of such courts. Our failure to enforce any right or
                provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or
                provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing. In the
                event that a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of
                these Terms to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remaining
                provisions will remain in full force and effect.<br>
