           <p>If you're in a specific industry, we can help you to bootstrap your analytics service with our pre-defined recipes. The pre-defined recipes turn your generic Rakam projects into real analytics services with many pre-built reports and dashboards.</p>
       <p>You can create new reports based on your needs, modify the existing one or just delete the reports and dashboard that you don't want to use. You don't need to buy service from a gaming analytics solution if you're in gaming industry or use Google Analytics for your websites. You can define your own metrics or alter the existing ones that we have defined for you. The current analytics services serve a generic purpose and you can't modify the metrics that they have defined.</p></div>
